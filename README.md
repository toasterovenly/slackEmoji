# slackEmoji
Emoji I like to add to Slack workspaces.

All files are supposed to be 128x128 pixels. (I haven't verified.)

All files have normalized names where words are separated by underscores. No hyphens. No camel case.

All related emoji should have the related word first. E.g. :dance_carlton: and :dance_hammer: not :carlton_dance: and :hammer_dance:.
